# Linked Lists are a data structure.
## They appear a lot in Programming Interviews.

The idea is that you have a Node, and each node has as properties.
* Data. ( Can be a Number, A String, An Object etc. )
* A reference to the next Node.
* ( A reference is when you store the memory address of an data type, as a property of a class or object ).

* A linked List has two important Nodes.
  * The Head and Tail.
    * The Head is the first node and has no other Node reference it.
    * The Tail is the last node and does not reference another node. It instead
      references Null.
