# Linked Lists are a data structure.
## They appear a lot in Programming Interviews.

Linked Lists have a Sub Class or Object that is called a __Node__: 
* Data. ( Can be a Number, A String, An Object etc. )
* A reference to the next Node.
( A reference is when you store the memory address of an data type, as a property of a class or object ).

* A linked List has two important Nodes.
The __Head__ and __Tail__.
    * The __Head__ is the __first node__ and has __No other Node reference it__.
    * The __Tail__ is the __last node__ and __does not reference another node. It instead
      references Null__.
