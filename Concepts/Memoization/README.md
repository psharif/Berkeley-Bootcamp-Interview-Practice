# Memoization

## Memoization is the technique of being able to cache an result of a function in order to have it readily available if it were to be called again.

   This technique is used a lot in conjuction with recursion. For example if you wanted to know the value of the fibonacci sequence, you might be calling fib(1) N times where N is the index of the sequence you are looking to get the value of.
   But if we use memoization to store the value of fib(1) it will only be called one extra time because the value is cached.
