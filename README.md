# Berkeley-Bootcamp-Interview-Practice

This is a repo, for all Berkeley Bootcamp students to share interview question solutions, resources, and advice.

If you are a collobarator feel free to push up any solutions or questions, all programming languages are allowed. 

If you are pushing up code, please comment with steps to your solution so that others can benefit from the way you solved your 
problem or can understand your thought process for the question. 

There will also be a Slack channel on the Berkeley Bootcamp Slack if you guys wanna discuss any questions you are having or 
resources you might be using.
